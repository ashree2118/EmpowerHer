                    Reproductive health is a crucial aspect of women's overall well-being. It encompasses a range of
                    topics including menstrual health, contraception, fertility, and pregnancy care. Understanding the
                    menstrual cycle is vital for managing reproductive health. Regular check-ups with a healthcare
                    provider can help identify any potential issues early on.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">
                    It's essential for women to be educated about different contraceptive methods available to them, as
                    well as the importance of preconception care for those planning to conceive. Additionally, prenatal
                    care during pregnancy ensures the health of both mother and baby, allowing for timely interventions
                    if complications arise.

                    Mental wellness is integral to living a fulfilling life. It involves emotional, psychological, and
                    social well-being. Women often face unique challenges that can impact their mental health, including
                    hormonal changes, work-life balance, and societal expectations.
                </p>
                <p class="resource-content">
                    Practices such as mindfulness, yoga, and regular physical activity can significantly improve mental
                    health. Seeking help from mental health professionals and building a support network of friends and
                    family is equally important. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when needed.

                <p class="expert-content">
                    Preventive health measures are essential for maintaining overall health. Regular screenings such as
                    Pap smears, mammograms, and bone density tests are recommended for women at different life stages.
                    These screenings can help detect potential health issues before they become serious.
                </p>
                <p class="expert-content">
                    In addition to screenings, adopting a healthy lifestyle through balanced nutrition, regular
                    exercise, and sufficient sleep can reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Staying informed about
                    vaccinations and staying current on recommended health guidelines is also crucial.
